          <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<h4><strong>My name is Grant. I design products and stories that bring joy to
              users and users to your business.</strong></h4> 

          <p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a UX designer and front-end Developer, I have a passion for visual
            storytelling and new challenges. I
            recently earned my certificate in Full-Stack web development from the University of Washington, where I
            developed skills in JavaScript, Cascading Style Sheets, and “Mobile-First” web design. I have developed a
            unique understanding of business objectives and shifting cultures from working both nationally and
            internationally in diverse industries including Technology, Entertainment, Education, and Construction.
            <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strong lateral and big-picture thinking paired with prototyping and
            visioning skills supports me in
            communicating with shareholders from both a top-down perspective and a grassroots understanding. A
            background in graphic design and building interactive, collaborative artworks has given me experience
            leading teams of three to 15 people to accomplish ambitious projects.

            <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It started with little things. like being 10 and finding a piece of clay (I
            grew up in the red dirt of
            Oklahoma—clay was everywhere). I was shaping it into a ball, determined to make something out of it. When my
            friend said “no, you can’t just make stuff; you have to know what you’re doing!” I squished the ball around
            my finger and told him it was now a candleholder. As a kid I also knew that broken toys were the best; you
            could fix them and learn something, or you take the
            parts and create something new. My two favorite toys were a hammer and glue.

            <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was full of silly antics, but I’ve never forgotten my childhood sense of
            curiosity or what I learned way back when. You can make anything;
            all it requires is a little raw material and the willingness to see the world in a new way. And not letting
            anyone tell you that it can’t be done.

            <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have made many things since then, some not quite so little: metal
            sculptures and wood furniture, poems and
            paintings, gardens and buildings. A few scars and too many ideas. One of my proudest was creating a degree
            program at the University of Illinois.

            <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I went to graduate school in Theatre Design, Technology and Management.
            While I was there, I began to see
            that Theatre was the business of creating new experiences for people. With new technologies being developed
            at a breakneck pace online and on the stage, it became clear that I wanted to help people have better
            experiences by using technology humanely. I petitioned the head of the department to create my own plan of
            study, <i><b>Studies in Experiential Environments Design</b></i>. Using the theatre’s magic of crafting new worlds as a
            foundation, SEED brought together many different design disciplines: Graphic, Industrial, Furniture,
            Interactivity, Architecture, Fashion, Robotics, Lighting, Scenic, and Projections. The outcome was to create
            a program that focused on the <i>Audience</i> first, using any and all tools available to help create the best
            experience possible. I have since used my acquired skills to take part in and lead collaborations crafting
            everything from Kabuki to Contemporary Dance, and then from Industrial trade shows to art installations.

            <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing how important online experiences are in people’s day-to-day lives, I
            enrolled in a full stack web
            development bootcamp at the University of Washington and began to train myself in the principles of UX. As I
            look forward, I see more and more experiences for customers that blend the virtual and the real, using new
            technologies and platforms that interface with IRL environments and that create more loyal relationships
            between clients and their customers.

            <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I love collaborating with small(ish) groups, and the most exciting part of
            the process for me is when
            everyone gets to pitch in their first “Big Idea”. Even more satisfying is when everyone’s big ideas start to
            merge, and narratives develop; when we get to be storytellers. By focusing on the story, research, testing,
            talking, revision, and iteration, we can find new ways to reach people and keep them coming back for more.

            <!-- Known for an insatiable curiosity, I focus on finding
                                innovative solutions by asking penetrating questions. I have recently been working with
                                several local health and wellness companies to develop a web page for information, as
                                well as tracking new clients and scheduling. I am excited to find ways to leverage my
                                skills as a storyteller as a part of lean, innovative teams.     -->
