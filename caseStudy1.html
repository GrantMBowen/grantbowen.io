                            <p> <strong>About:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Friendl-e Co. is an early
                            stage startup that offers mobile in-play betting and gaming apps
                            for recreational gambling.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <strong>Challenge:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Friendl-e wanted to
                            develop a low-stakes game that could bring sports superfans and
                            people who don't really watch NFL football at all together to
                            socialize. "Watching football and betting is a blast, if you
                            know enough," says Friendl-e CoFounder Sarah Arnold. "But for a
                            lot of us who don't know anything about sports, going with friends
                            to 'watch the game' is super boring." Friendl-e was looking for
                            a way to make watching football on TV a social event that even newbies
                            could enjoy.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <strong>Solution:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Friendl-e Co. put together a team of 3 collaborators
                            to design, build, test, and launch an interactive game to play during SuperBowl LIV.
                            The team used techniques such as Card-sorting, Process flows,
                            wireframing, prototyping, beta-testing, presentation and
                            post-mortem, with the added challenge of a 4-week turnaround time.

                            <br>
                            <strong>Result:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Delivered an engaging
                            product that was used by 50+ people concurrently during multiple
                            private
                            SuperBowl watch parties. Currently looking at next steps and
                            development opportunities.

                            <strong>PROBLEM</strong>
                            <br>
                            How can we use technology to ‘be present’ in the moment and with the people you are with?
                            We began investigating how to create meaningful, in-person relationships and interactions
                            between people via technology.
                            <br>
                            <br>

                            <strong>PROCESS</strong>
                            <br>
                            Technical Requirements: Technical requirements: use React.js, an SQL Database, and
                            Node.js/express for the backend.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            We began with several ideas for how interactions IRL could be made better using basic
                            internet technology, one of which was a way to interact in a bar/restaurant/pub setting,
                            where there would be a mix of known associates, strangers, and close aquaintences. We talked
                            about
                            finding ways to integrate a typical chat function and online ordering website into an
                            evening
                            experience, such as using your phone to request drinks, order your food, or
                            communicate with other patrons. We described the similarities between this and the
                            “telephone bar” in which we could all vaguely remember hearing or seeing somewhere, but not
                            remembering where. <a href='http://www.hilobrow.com/2017/06/04/planet-of-peril-17/'
                                target="blank" class='badge badge-info'>A History of the Telephone Bar</a> (hint: it’s
                            from
                            seeing cabaret too many times-”The telephone song”)
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            As we explored the idea, it felt too abstract, so we wanted to create a game that
                            would pull people together (friends and strangers alike) to have a shared experience while
                            out at the bar. One team member suggested a “penny bet” game that he had played in which
                            opponents bet pennies on what the next play would be in a series (American football). This
                            sounded promising, as it was exactly the type of low stakes/high engagement activity we were
                            looking for.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            The challenge was now how to create a “penny bet” app that is extremely easy to learn, low
                            cost (time and money), that allowed for the most engagement IRL with other patrons who are
                            playing the game.
                            <br>
                            One major constraint in the process was that our team of three was to be responsible for
                            conceptualizing, designing, building/developing both front and back end, and testing within
                            4 weeks.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Once we settled on the “penny bets” approach, we started working through the game play
                            logic.

                            Our team began thinking about our typical users and how might we address their
                            needs. After brainstorming user stories, we created two personas to focus our
                            UX efforts.

                                                        game day events. Her husband likes to play fantasy

                                                        She would like a way to enjoy watching the game as much as her

                                                        She like board games, and tries hard to find new and interesting
                                                        games for her friends to play when they come over.

                            <p>Thinking through the player's journey, it seemed pretty straightforward: guess the next
                                play, hit a button to guess, wait while the play is in progress, and then wait for the
                                house to compute your score.

                                As we began to investigate how each player interacted with
                                the house, it became clear that everyone would have to adhere to a strict timeline of
                                events (ie, the player could not place bets while the ball is in play; the scoring can
                                only happen after the play is run; progression in gameplay is rigidly defined by the
                                snap of the ball, etc).

                                <br>

                                We developed the user journey more concretely to define how the player and the house
                                both interact with the football game, to create a more complete picture:
